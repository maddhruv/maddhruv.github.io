In this comparision guide, we’re going to look at some of the best React UI Components Libraries/Frameworks/Kits that you can use in your next react app/project.

Before writing the content of this blog I have evaluated a ton of them on the following criterias which I feel are worth checking, before choosing any one of them. There is no winner or loser in this race, just choose the one which fits your requirements.

- Quantity of Components
- Tree-shakeable
- SSR
- Customizability - Custom Theme and Components Overrides
- Typescript
- Docs
- Websites using the library
- Size Cost

## Material UI

The Material Design Inspired - MUI or Material UI is a wonderful library for your next project, as it comes with over 41 commonly used fully-fledged UI components and yeah built in [TypeScript Support](https://material-ui.com/guides/typescript/). Bundle Minimization or Treeshakeability can be easily achieved with path imports and ES Modules. And as the Docs say “Material-UI was designed from the ground-up with the constraint of rendering on the server” and hence is very SSR Friendly. With over 60K GitHub Stars and 17K Forks, MUI is one of the most popular React Repositories you can find on the web. The library and the components can be easily customized as per need, using a custom Theme or the withStyles HOC. Material-UI comes with a package [cost of 425kB and 101kB gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=material-ui/?ref=maddhruv)
